FutileAshBananaExample
======================

A port of the Banana example game from the Futile project into Ash.NET in Unity3D. 

This project _requires_ the following libraries to work:

* [Ash.NET](1) by David Arno
* [Futile](2) by Matt Rix

And, of course, a copy of [Unity3D 4.x](5). 

Please note: This is not a _good_ example of how to do a game using an entity system framework. It is _my_ attempt to get all the bits working together, using the existing [Futile](2) banana example game. Please see the [Asteroids Example Game](6) for a good example of how to program an entity system game. I would be happy with any constructive criticism of the architecture for this example, as I would _like_ to make it a better example of an entity systems style game. 

You also couldn't go wrong reading [T-Machine's entity systems blog posts](7), or [Richard Lord's blog](3). 

Also thanks to [Richard Lord](3) for the original [Ash Entity Framework](4).
